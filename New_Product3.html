                        states Cao Wei, Shu Han and Eastern Wu into a single text organized by individual biography.

                        of the people of Japan, from ancient teenage priest-queens to teeming hordes of salarymen, a
                        nation that once sought to conquer China, yet also shut itself away for two centuries in
                        self-imposed seclusion.First revealed to Westerners in the chronicles of Marco Polo, Japan was a
                        legendary faraway land defended by a fearsome Kamikaze storm and ruled by a divine sovereign. It
                        was the terminus of the Silk Road, the furthest end of the known world, a fertile source of
                        inspiration for European artists, and an enduring symbol of the mysterious East. In recent
                        times, it has become a powerhouse of global industry, a nexus of popular culture, and a
                        harbinger of post-industrial decline.
