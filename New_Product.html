                        eleventh birthday, he learns that he is a wizard. A man named Rubeus Hagrid tells him that he
                        can attend Hogwarts, a school of magic. Hagrid explains that when Harry was an infant, a Dark
                        wizard named Voldemort murdered his parents and tried to kill him as well. However, Voldemort's
                        killing curse rebounded and seemingly destroyed him, leaving a lightning bolt-shaped scar on
                        Harry's forehead. Unbeknownst to Harry, this event made him famous among wizards.

                        in danger and must promise not to return to Hogwarts. When Harry refuses, Dobby uses magic to
                        destroy a pudding made by Aunt Petunia. Believing that Harry created the mess, Uncle Vernon
                        locks him in his room. The Ministry of Magic sends a notice accusing Harry of performing
                        underage magic and threatening to expel him from Hogwarts.
