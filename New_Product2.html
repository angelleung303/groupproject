                        written by Charles Perrault, published in Paris in 1697. The work became popular because it was
                        written at a time when fairy tales were fashionable amongst aristocrats in Parisian literary
                        salons. Perrault wrote the work when he retired from court as secretary to Jean-Baptiste
                        Colbert, minister to Louis XIV of France. Colbert's death may have forced Perrault's retirement,
                        at which point he turned to writing. Scholars have debated as to the origin of his tales and
                        whether they are original literary fairy tales modified from commonly known stories, or based on
                        stories written by earlier medieval writers such as Boccaccio.
