                        <span class="bookdescriptiontitle">Description</span>: The central thesis of the book is that
                        inequality is not an accident, but rather a feature of capitalism and can only be reversed
                        through state interventionism. The book thus argues that, unless capitalism is reformed, the
                        very democratic order will be threatened.

                        <span class="bookdescriptiontitle">Description</span>: Division of labour has caused a greater
                        increase in production than any other factor. This diversification is greatest for nations with
                        more industry and improvement, and is responsible for "universal opulence" in those countries.
                        This is in part due to increased quality of production, but more importantly because of
                        increased efficiency of production, leading to a higher nominal output of units produced per
                        time unit. Agriculture is less amenable than manufacturing to division of labour; hence, rich
                        nations are not so far ahead of poor nations in agriculture as in manufacturing.

                        <span class="bookdescriptiontitle">Description</span>: In Das Kapital (1867), Marx proposes that
                        the motivating force of capitalism is in the exploitation of labor, whose unpaid work is the
                        ultimate source of surplus value. The owner of the means of production is able to claim the
                        right to this surplus value because they are legally protected by the ruling regime through
                        property rights and the legally established distribution of shares which are by law distributed
                        only to company owners and their board members. The historical section shows how these rights
                        were acquired in the first place chiefly through plunder and conquest and the activity of the
                        merchant and "middle-man".

                        <span class="bookdescriptiontitle">Description</span>: Pinker criticizes a number of common
                        ideas about language, for example that children must be taught to use it, that most people's
                        grammar is poor, that the quality of language is steadily declining, that the kind of linguistic
                        facilities that a language provides (for example, some languages have words to describe light
                        and dark, but no words for colors) has a heavy influence on a person's possible range of
                        thoughts (the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis), and that nonhuman animals have been taught language (see
                        Great ape language). Pinker sees language as an ability unique to humans, produced by evolution
                        to solve the specific problem of communication among social hunter-gatherers. He compares
                        language to other species' specialized adaptations such as spiders' web-weaving or beavers'
                        dam-building behavior, calling all three "instincts".
